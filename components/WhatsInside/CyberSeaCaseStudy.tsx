              That meant my job wasn&apos;t just deciding how things looked — spacing and
              content aren&apos;t just visual choices, they shape how usable the whole
              experience is. It taught me that a huge part of design isn&apos;t just
              creating solutions, but{" "}

            Through this experience, I learned the importance of iterating quickly and
            refining ideas as a team, rather than perfecting every part in isolation.
            That said, the end result was more impactful than I ever expected.
