// Full case-study content for the Spotify Guessr project, replicated from
// Amy's old portfolio (https://amywang.framer.website/spotify) at her
// request: "copy this case study exactly."
//
// Layout, per Amy's correction: the whole page reads as a 2-column split.
// Left column (1fr) carries the label — the numbered section eyebrow
// ("01 / Initial Planning") stacked directly on top of the first
// subheading ("The Problem") for that section, then just the bare
// subheading for every row after that. Right column (1.5fr) carries the
// actual content — paragraphs, lists, placeholder media. No serif font
// anywhere on this page; font-body (Public Sans) only, weight does the
// differentiating.
//
// Shared layout/text/section primitives now live in CaseStudyKit.tsx (see
// that file), used by every case study on the site — this file keeps only
// what's actually specific to Spotify Guessr: its section nav, meta/insight
// data, highlight color, and every Row's real content below.
//
// Rendered only for the "spotify-guessr" project id — see
// app/projects/[id]/page.tsx. Every other project keeps the existing
// minimal "coming soon" shell.

            As the designer taking on a client, it is important to understand ALL of
            their needs &amp; expectations! This means ensuring that you are
            communicating throughout the process, checking in to make sure everything
            is okay, and consistently asking questions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[36px]">
            Sometimes, the client doesn&apos;t have a tech background and will not
            understand the plausibility of certain features. Other times, they will not
            be able to communicate what they don&apos;t explicitly like about a design.
            As the sole product designer, it was my job to make sure I was transparent
            and created something that met the client&apos;s standard!
